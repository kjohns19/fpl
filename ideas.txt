Grammar - postfix everything


Variabes
========
First line is the type
Value after

Complex Data types
Arrays - Folders, names are indices
Structs - Folders, files are struct data members


Functions
=========
Create folder
	Arguments - names of params are known, files created with those names 

Return values - create file _return in ../, copy to assigned variable

States number of parameters to use from stack

Executed with call operator

layout
foo a b 2 fun
	code
endfun =


Built-in Functions
==================
+, -, *, **, /, %, &&, ||, !, ?, ^, <, <=, >, >= , ==, !=


Program Scope
=============
Top level directory - search for function calls here first
Search in stack for variables

Code blocks -> don't exist, data accessible outside of "scope"


Opreators/Keywords
==================
return
ref, deref
heap
delete
call
then, end
fun, endfun
while, endwhile
exit
at


Control Flow Logic
==================
x y < then		(match then & end/else, else & end, until count = 0)
	then		(see else, count = 1, take else)
	else
	end
else
end

x y < ! then
...
end

a b < while
...
endwhile

z = (x < y) ? a : b;
z a b x y < ? =

x y < then
	z = a
end
else
	z = b
end

str "hi there" =
	create temp file for string literals, primitives


Pointers
========
Absolute paths (maybe relative to the top-level)

i array.2 ref =

j i deref =

ref - creates tmp file containing the path, used in assignment
deref - replace with path name on the stack
delete tmp files after it's popped off of the stack


Heap
====
Top-level folder called heap, containing files with generated names
Accessed with pointers
heap operator
	creates object on the heap
	creates tmp file in current program scope
	puts tmp file on the stack, pointer can be assigned
	heap deref object =
delete operator
	deletes object on the heap
	pointer deref delete


Stack
=====
delete operator
	deletes object on the heap


Object Operator
===============
i object =


I/O
===
Operators
	intput - read line, put into tmp variable, put on stack
	output - pop off stack, print string value
